Used Xpert to get Object.entries line of code

Found Colorscale on ploty website to match colors

Had to look around stack overflow and use Xpert to get to buildCharts/BuildMetadata and also find out the modified version of that d3 loop from earlier

Everthing else was in my notes, but took a lot more searching the web then previous assignments
